# Signature Comparison Utility

A Rust utility for verifying that the signature of a transaction from the blockchain network matches the signature of an identical transaction generated by a local signer. This tool is useful for debugging signature generation issues and ensuring transaction integrity.a

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the utility directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/seed-silo-mono/utils/sig-compare
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

### Required Variables

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key (hex string without 0x prefix) of the account that signed the transactions
- `TX_HASHES`: Comma-separated list of transaction hashes to verify

### Optional Variables

- `RPC_URL`: RPC endpoint URL (default: "https://sepolia.optimism.io")

## Usage

### Using Environment Variables

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_hex"
export TX_HASHES="0xabc123...,0xdef456...,0x789ghi..."
export RPC_URL="https://your-rpc-endpoint.com"
cargo run
```

## Supported Networks

The utility works with any Ethereum-compatible network that supports EIP-1559 transactions.

## Limitations

- Only supports EIP-1559 (Type 2) transactions
- Requires the exact private key used to sign the original transactions
- Network transactions must be accessible via the provided RPC endpoint
